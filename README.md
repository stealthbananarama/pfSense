# Installing pfSense on a Sophos XG 115
## Console Cable Notes
The Sophos XG 115 has a VGA port and a Console port: ![file](assets/firewall_back.png) 
This method uses a console cable to connect to the firewall.  [The cable I used](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08T16TCN5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is available on Amazon, and it has not caused me any problems since I started using it months ago.
